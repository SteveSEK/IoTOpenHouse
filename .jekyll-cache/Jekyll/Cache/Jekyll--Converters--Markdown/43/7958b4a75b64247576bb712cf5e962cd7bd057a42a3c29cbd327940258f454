<h4 id="google-adsense">Google Adsense</h4>

<h2 id="disclosure-policy">Disclosure Policy</h2>

<p>I make money on this website through affiliate programs. If you click an affiliate link or ad banner and buy the product, you help support this website because I‚Äôll get a percentage of that sale.</p>

<p>Currently I‚Äôm an affiliate for Amazon and Google Adsense.</p>

<p>What this means for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I became an affiliate to earn revenue towards the costs of running and maintaining this website. Where I have direct control over which ads are served on this website I offer only products that are directly related to the topic of this website and products that a reader/subscriber would have a genuine interest in or need of.</li>
  <li>I do not and will not recommend a product just for the sake of making money.</li>
  <li>I do not let the compensation I receive influence the content, topics, posts, or opinions expressed on this website.</li>
  <li>I respect and value my readers too much to write anything other than my own genuine and objective opinions and advice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just like this website, my Disclosure Policy is a work in progress. As the revenue streams evolve, so will this page.</p>
