#### Telit acquiring Thales’ IoT portfolio
>"Telit Cinterion is expected to put further pressure on the other Western module suppliers due to its broadened portfolio including security and eSIM/iSIM capabilities. >The company is also spinning off its automotive IoT unit to focus on Industrial IoT. We expect Telit Cinterion to become the second biggest IoT module company outside >China when the acquisition closes.”

#### Semtech acquiring Sierra Wireless
>“In the digital supply chain age, end-to-end tracking demands multiple connectivity modes. Hence, the collaboration of cellular and LoRa technology is expected to be >beneficial for end-to-end tracking. Cellular components had been missing from the Semtech portfolio prior to the acquisition. For example, if chipsets such as the Lora >Edge LR1120 get embedded into a combined module with LTE-M or Cat 1, the resulting module covers almost all major wireless types of connectivity, including Sub-GHz >LoRa, SATCOM S-band, 2.4 GHz Lora, and Cellular IoT.”
